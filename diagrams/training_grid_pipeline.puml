input --> transform
labels --> transform

transform --> tfidf1
tfidf1 --> lr1
lr1 --> grid

transform --> tfidf2
tfidf2 --> scaler1
scaler1 --> lr2
lr2 --> grid

transform --> tfidf3
tfidf3 --> pca1
pca1 --> lr3
lr3 --> grid

transform --> tfidf4
tfidf4 --> pca2
pca2 --> scaler2
scaler2 --> lr4
lr4 --> grid

grid --> eval

note right of eval
  - Best parameters
  - Classification report
  - Confusion matrix
  - Learning curves
  - Top features
  - Feature importance by class
end note
