TfidfVectorizer:
- Accounts for word importance across all reviews
- Downweights common words that appear in many reviews (like "hotel", "room", "stay")
- Gives higher weight to distinctive words that might be more indicative of rating (like "excellent", "terrible", "amazing")
- Better for capturing words that are truly meaningful for the rating prediction
- Helps reduce the impact of length variation between reviews

Bag of Words (CountVectorizer):
- Simple word frequency count
- Doesn't account for word importance across documents
- Longer reviews will have higher counts which might skew results
- Might give too much importance to commonly occurring words
- Simpler to interpret

Recommendation:
For your rating prediction task, I would recommend TfidfVectorizer because:
1. Hotel reviews often contain common domain-specific words that should be downweighted
2. The distinctive adjectives and sentiment words that correlate with ratings will get higher weights
3. Reviews can vary significantly in length, and TF-IDF helps normalize this
4. It generally performs better than pure word counts for sentiment/rating prediction tasks

PCA after TF-IDF! This is actually a common combination because:

1. Benefits:
- Reduces dimensionality of the sparse TF-IDF matrix
- Can help with computational efficiency
- Reduces noise in the data
- Can help prevent overfitting
- Handles multicollinearity between similar words/features
